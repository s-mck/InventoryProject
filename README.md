# InventoryProject
First major project, completed for PROG24178 - JAVA 2 at Sheridan College. March 2018.
Written using NetBeans and JDK 8 U161.

The goal of this project was to use the concepts taught (Classes, Relationships, JavaFX, etc) to build an inventory system.

Requirements:

1. At least 1 base class that represents the item being kept track of (books, cars, etc.). I chose video games.
2. Class that uses List/ArrayList to hold the collection of items.
3. Ability to search, sort, add, edit, and delete items.
4. Read/Write capabilities to either text or binary file.
5. A GUI created using JavaFX.

The SRC folder contains the entire NetBeans project.
The INSTALL folder contains an executable jar.
